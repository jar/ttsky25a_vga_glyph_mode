# Tiny Tapeout VGA Glyph Mode

![example VGA output](docs/screenshot.png)

This began as an entry into the Tiny Tapeout 08 Demoscene competition.  A
couple improvements were made since that time.  The name is a play on the VGA
Text Mode, but this project uses glyphs seen in [The Matrix Digital
Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SneR61OG4ZI) -- a brilliant effect from
the best science fiction movie since 1999.
